## Description

LegoRobot is an Object-Oriented Software Design, ERAU SE 555, project in which a Lego Mindstorms EV3 robot is built and programmed to wander around the Lehman building, converse with people, and hand out flyers. A rasberry pi is used for all interactions (hearing and speaking)

## Using the Code
The Lejos application will only run on the Lego Mindstorms EV3 brick. The .jar file must be uploaded onto the EV3 brick. In addition, you must have the Lejos library downloaded onto the EV3 brick before executing the file.

After cloning the respository, open the LegoRobot class and select "Run as Lejos EV3 Program" while the robot is connected via USB or Bluetooth to your computer. This will compile the .jar file, upload it to the brick, and execute it. Alternatively, you can upload the LegoRobot.jar file found in the main directory of the repository directly onto the robot via the Lego Mindstorms Control Center found in the Eclipse toolbar.

The listening code runs on a Raspberry Pi. Download the executable file onto the Raspberry Pi and use the terminal to start the file. In order to run properly, a dictionary and pronunciation guide must also be present.
